# LIFT-TO-CLG : Vehicle Sharing & Ride Matching Platform


This project is a web-based platform designed to help students at VIT connect for vehicle sharing. It facilitates two types of users:

- **Primary users:** Students who have vehicles and can offer rides.
- **Secondary users:** Students without vehicles who want to find rides.

Secondary users can search and filter primary users based on locality and name, and choose to go with them if their route aligns.
